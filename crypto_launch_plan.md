# 🪙 Crypto Launch Plan (Arbitrum-based)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Launch a general-purpose cryptocurrency (unlimited supply, community-based) on Arbitrum, used for payments, DeFi lending, governance, and collateral.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Project Design (1–2 weeks)

### 🔹 Deliverables:

- Project name, logo, and brand assets
- Whitepaper (outlines vision, tech stack, tokenomics, roadmap)
- Governance plan (voting, proposals, treasury)
- Legal compliance research (jurisdiction, token classification)

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Token + Smart Contract Development (2–4 weeks)

### 🔹 Stack:

- Language: **Solidity**
- L2: **Arbitrum One** or **Orbit**
- Token standard: **ERC-20**

### 🔹 Contracts to Build:

- ✅ Custom ERC-20 Token (with inflation/deflation logic)
- ✅ Staking Contract (for PoS-like validator or delegator rewards)
- ✅ Governance Contract (voting based on token weight)
- ✅ Treasury Contract (holds reserve tokens for community grants, rewards)

---

## 📍 Phase 3: L2 Deployment & Testing (2–4 weeks)

### 🔹 Tasks:

- Deploy all contracts on **Arbitrum Testnet**
- Write unit + integration tests using **Hardhat** or **Foundry**
- Build a minimal frontend to test staking, voting, and transfers
- Audit code (internal + open-source tools like Slither, MythX)
- Optional: apply for formal audit if budget allows

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Token Launch Strategy (2–3 weeks)

### 🔹 Token Launch Options:

- ✅ Airdrop to early adopters or ETH/Arbitrum users
- ✅ Liquidity bootstrap (Uniswap pool or Arbitrum-native DEX)
- ✅ Staking campaign (earn tokens for helping secure the network)
- ✅ Ecosystem grants (for DeFi projects building on your token)

### 🔹 Distribution:

- 100% community-based:
  - 50% to early users/stakers
  - 25% to liquidity incentives
  - 15% to treasury/DAO
  - 10% to ecosystem grants

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Ecosystem Launch (1–3 months)

### 🔹 Frontend App:

- Web wallet interface (connect MetaMask, show balance, stake, vote)
- DAO dashboard (governance proposals)
- DeFi portal (lending, borrowing, farming)

### 🔹 Community:

- Launch Discord, Twitter, community blog
- Host AMAs, giveaways, developer grants
- Start governance with a simple proposal (e.g., inflation rate or staking cap)

---

## 🗓️ Total Time Estimate: **3 to 6 months**

---

## 🔑 Optional Later Phases

- Launch an **Orbit chain** for even more control (custom gas token)
- Enable **cross-chain bridges**
- Integrate with **Lending platforms, DEXs**, or **LayerZero** for interoperability
- List on **CoinGecko**, **CMC**, and **DEXs**
